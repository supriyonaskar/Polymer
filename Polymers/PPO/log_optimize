# In this code we will optimize a monomer structure using scf/cc-pVDZ 

# Then we wil calculate ESP and RESP charges
 
# Then we build the polymer 

# we have the initial structure of the monomer from avogadro 
 
# You need to have the following modules: numpy, math, mdtraj, pysimm, psi4, resp, pandas 

# you need to have the follwing files: input_parameters.dat file and {monomername}_initial.xyz 
 
# input_parameters.dat file should have 7 columns 

#1. Index of head atom of the monomer (index starts from 1) 

#2. Index of the tail atom of the monomer 

#3. Hydrogen attached to the head atom of the monomer 

#4. Hydrogen attached to the tail atom of the monomer 

#5. Name of the molecule (You should remember that your initial xyz file of the monomer should have a name like {moleculename}_monomer.mol2), also make sure xyz file have two remarks like in begining. 
 
#6. Flag to keep or remove all the unnecessary files dusing the code execution. if 0 it keeps everything, elseif 1 it removes everything 

#7. Flag to optimize or not, if 1 it will optimize, if 0 it will build the polymer...else not 
# Sometimes, you may not have some parameters in your force-field database, then you have to modify gaff.json to include those.
