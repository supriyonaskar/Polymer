### Input parameters for polymer building ###
#1. Index of head atom of the monomer (index starts from 1)
#2. Index of the tail atom of the monomer 
#3. Hydrogen attached to the head atom of the monomer
#4. Hydrogen attached to the tail atom of the monomer
#5. Chain length distribution it should be written like x1 x2 x3 x4. Suppose you want to build a polymer with chains havinf 10-mer, 15-mer and 20-mer then write 10 15 20
#6. Name of the molecule (You should remember that your initial xyz file of the monomer should have a name like {moleculename}_initial.xyz), also make sure xyz file have two remarks like in begining. 
#7. To remove files set it to 1. To keep make it 0
#8. Flag to optimize or not, if 1 it will optimize, if 0 it will build the polymer...else not
### Sometimes, you may not have some parameters in your force-field database, then you have to modify gaff.json to include those. 
### That's all, you are ready to build your first polymer ###
